    /// referenced by other type records.
    /// The second range is for the type records that are directly referenced in symbols
    /// All type records must have a starting leaf index in these first two ranges.
    /// The third range of leaf indices are used to build up complex lists such as the field
    /// list of a class type record. No type record can begin with one of the leaf indices.
    /// The fourth ranges of type indices are used to represent numeric data in a symbol or
    /// type record. These leaf indices are greater than 0x8000. At the point that type or
    /// symbol processor is expecting a numeric field, the next two bytes in the type record
    /// are examined.
    /// If the value is less than 0x8000, then the two bytes contain the numeric value.
    /// If the value is greater than 0x8000, then the data follows the leaf index in a format
    /// specified by the leaf index.
    /// The final range of leaf indices are used to force alignment of subfields within a
